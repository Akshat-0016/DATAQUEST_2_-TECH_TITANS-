For the project the main idea is:
    1>  +finding out what is the sensitive data? 
        +what is the impact of it?
        +how is the shared i,e means of sharing data?
        +what is the target audience that is which dept of employees
        +If the receiver is identified by the company's database
    2>finding out the means from which the data is shared or exposed
        +Mail.
        +WhatsApp.
        +MS Teams
        +messages
    3> Finding the patterns in the data
        + pins
        + OTPs
        + passwords
        + keys
        + personal information
        + account information
    4> Identifying the patterns and categorizing patterns with the help of a metric- "Sensitivity Score"
        + sensitive (OTPs, pins, passwords)
        + careful (account information)
        + informative (personal information)
    5> Action on basis of sensitivity
        + sensitive -> Block and inform correct authority
        + careful -> request review
        + informative -> make a log of activity

What should we include in the code?:
    1> Extracting data from files (.pdf, .csv, .jpeg)
    2> Finding the sensitivity patterns and generating a sensitivity score
    3> According to the sensitivity score, further actions that are to be enforced upon.
    4> Add a priority metric in UI to calibrate the sensitivity of a particular attribute.
