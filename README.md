Automated Data Leak Prevention (DLP) System for Internal Files
Problem Statement

Organizations struggle to prevent sensitive data from leaking through internal file shares or email systems. Manual monitoring of such transmissions is inefficient and prone to errors. This project aims to develop an automated system that detects sensitive data transmission in real-time and takes preventive actions such as blocking or alerting.

Solution Overview

The Automated Data Leak Prevention (DLP) System analyzes files and emails to detect the presence of sensitive information like passwords, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and intellectual property. It leverages a combination of pattern matching and machine learning to classify and respond to potential data leaks.

Features

Sensitive Data Detection: Uses regular expressions (regex) to scan files and emails for sensitive data signatures (e.g., credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers).

Machine Learning Classification: Employs trained ML models to assess the sensitivity level of files and emails, improving detection accuracy.

Real-time Policy Engine: Automates decision-making by generating alerts or blocking suspicious transmissions based on defined policies.

Audit Logging: Maintains detailed logs of all scans, alerts, and actions for compliance and forensic purposes.

How It Works

Data Scanning: Files and emails are scanned using regex patterns tailored to identify sensitive information.

Classification: ML models analyze the scanned content to classify the sensitivity level.

Policy Enforcement: Based on classification, the system either allows, alerts, or blocks the transmission.

Logging: All events are logged for monitoring and auditing.

Technologies Used

Regular Expressions for pattern matching

Machine Learning frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)

Email and file handling libraries (e.g., Pythonâ€™s email, os, watchdog)

Logging and alerting mechanisms
